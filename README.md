The run_analysis.R file takes data generated by Smartlab at the University Studi di Genova, and runs a transformation.

The team at study lab attached a smartphone to 30 volunteers and recorded the acceleration, then provided a number of measures based on this raw data.

We've extracted the mean and standard deviations of these measurements, and provided them as a mean for each participant for each activity.
